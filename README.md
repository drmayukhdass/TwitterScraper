# TwitterScraper

## This repository contains two main files for conducting sentiment and emotion analysis on Twitter data using machine learning models. The first file is for uploading training data and training three different models: Linear SVC, Naive Bayes, and BERT (both bert-base-uncased and bert-large-uncased). The trained models are saved and can be loaded for testing accuracy.

## The second file retrieves tweets from the Twitter API using Tweepy. These retrieved tweets are then classified according to intents using the saved machine learning models, followed by sentiment analysis and empath  analysis. Additional functionalities include retrieving tweets based on a keyword, specifying the count of tweets, selecting the top percent of emotions, and choosing the model of choice for analysis.
